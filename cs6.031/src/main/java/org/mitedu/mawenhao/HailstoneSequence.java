/**
 * <p>
 * As a running example, weâ€™re going to explore the hailstone sequence, which is
 * defined as follows. Starting with a number n, the next number in the sequence is n/2
 * if n is even, or 3n+1 if n is odd. The sequence ends when it reaches 1.
 * </p>
 * Here are some examples:
 * <p>
 * 2, 1<br/>
 * 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1<br/>
 * 4, 2, 1<br/>
 * 2n, 2n-1 , ... , 4, 2, 1<br/>
 * 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1<br/>
 * 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 6, 13, 40, ...? (where does this stop?)
 * </p>
